DHBarButtonItem is a UIBarButtonItem subclass that lets you create items out of arrays containing images,  text, and spacing.

You create this item using the class factory method:

  + (DHBarButtonItem *)itemWithImageItems:(NSArray *)itemsArray options:(NSDictionary *)optDict;

The "itemsArray" parameter contains instructions on how to build the first displayed image. The optDict parameter lets you set some initial conditions such as left and right side padding, and should contain arrays detailing all potential images or text which may appear in any given column (for the purpose of insuring sufficient spaces exists in that column. The returned object has the initial image set. The width of this and all future images is fixed and will not change.

When you specify an item, you can horizontally align it left, center, or right, and you can increase or decrease its vertical position relative to other items.

To change the displayed item, you message the object with: 

  - (void)imageFromItems:(NSArray *)items;

Look at the demo code in ViewController. m

Note 1: This code utilizes "ARC" - if you are not using it you will almost certainly need to fork this code and add the appropriate retain and releases.

Note 2: The icons used in the demo are from the free set of icons provided by Glyphish:  http://glyphish.com/
